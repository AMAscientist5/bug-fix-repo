                    The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB
                    As it is not session-based or does not expire time duration. it must be deleted via javascript or manually
               <br><br>
                    <strong>Session Storage:</strong>
                    The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB
                    Itâ€™s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is close
                    
                    localStorage and sessionStorage are almost the same. Both have the following rules: They store key/value pairs for a particular domain. The values stored may only be strings.

           <strong>What is local scope and global scope in JavaScript?</strong> 
Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript. The two types of scope are local and global. <br>

Global variables are those declared outside of a block. <br> Local variables are those declared inside of a block <br>
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const. These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. <br>
<br>
Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
Global JavaScript Variables
A variable declared Globally   (outside any function) becomes GLOBAL. A global variable has Global Scope:
Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. <br>
<br>
Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.
They all have Global Scope:
